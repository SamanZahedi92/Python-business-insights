## 💡 General About
This repository contains my solutions to data analysis exercises focusing on retail performance and promotional effectiveness. By using **Python** and **Pandas**, I transformed raw data into structured insights, focusing on financial metrics and statistical summaries.

## 🚗 Exercise 1: Car Sales Performance

### **About**
This project analyzes sales data for multiple car models (Beaufort, Salish, Labrador, Champlain, and Hudson) from 2018 to 2019. It focuses on dealership profitability and automated reporting.

### **Technical Description (Tasks Completed)**
In this exercise, I addressed the following data requirements:
* **Feature Creation:** Calculated the $\color{blue}{Profit\ per\ Unit}$ to determine which models have the highest margins.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created a secondary metric `Profit per unit2` to analyze variance.
* **Exploratory Analysis:** Generated full descriptive statistics (Mean, Median, Std Dev) for all sales columns.
* **Data Persistence:** Built a workflow to export the analyzed data into a new Excel file: `CarSalesByModelStart1.xlsx`.

## 🥤 Exercise 2: GoodBelly Promotional Study

### **About**
A statistical analysis of the "GoodBelly" probiotic juice brand across 126 Whole Foods stores. The project investigates how marketing variables (like demos and sales reps) impact weekly units sold.

### **Technical Description (Questions Answered)**
This script specifically answers the following analytical questions:
1. **Data Volume:** How many records and elements are in the dataset?
2. **Schema Audit:** What are the column names and data types (Integers vs. Floats)?
3. **Statistical Summary:** What is the numerical summary (count, min, max) of the promotional data?
4. **Volatility Check:** What is the $\color{green}{Standard\ Deviation}$ for all numeric columns (Sales, Price, Demos)?
5. **Sample Analysis:** What are the mean values for the first 50 records in the dataset?
